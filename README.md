# A Practical End to End ETL Development with Pentaho and Tableau Visualization


## Overview
This project is adapted and developed from the [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) course [Data Warehousing - The Ultimate Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-warehouse-the-ultimate-guide/). It comprises a practical demonstration and case study aimed at architecting and implementing a professional data warehouse end-to-end. Additionally, I am enhancing it by restructuring the data into yearly segments for designing and creating analytical visualizations for sales profitability using Tableau Desktop.

This practical demonstration provides a comprehensive understanding of establishing a complete end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow. It applies theoretical ETL concepts in a practical scenario, showcasing the entire workflow from extracting source data to loading it into the target schema. This case study helps visualize and understand the practical steps and considerations involved in building an ETL process.

The project also involves creating a dynamic sales profit dashboard to analyze year-over-year profit performance. The dashboard presents summaries of total profit, total price, and total cost for the current and previous year, monthly KPI data, and comparisons of profit by product categories. It also showcases weekly profit trends, highlighting weeks above and below average, and displays top profits by product name and brand. The interactive dashboard allows users to filter data by selecting any desired year, featuring dynamic charts and graphs for enhanced data analysis.
